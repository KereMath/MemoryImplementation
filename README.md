# MemoryImplementation
In this task, you are expected to implement basic memories as 2 Verilog modules. The modules together take a
binary number and an operation type (read/write) and then according to the operation type, either evaluate and
store the result of the evaluations to the given memory index (write mode) or return the previous data from the
given index of the memory (read mode).
